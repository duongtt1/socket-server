This NGINX configuration:

Sets up an upstream backend group to manage load balancing using the least_conn directive, which directs new connections to the backend with the least number of active connections.
Enables caching and sets cache-related options such as cache location, size, and duration.
Defines two location blocks:
The first block handles proxying requests to the backend servers and uses caching settings.
The second block serves static assets (images, CSS, JS) with specific caching rules and adds appropriate headers.
Enables gzip compression and configures compression settings.
With these improvements to your server code and the NGINX configuration, your application should be better prepared to handle a larger number of connections and perform more efficiently under heavy loads.
